# OneAI Roadmap: Future Capabilities & Extensions

Based on the product vision, here is a list of features and enhancements that can still be added to the OneAI Personal Intelligence OS:

## 1. Intelligence Layer Enhancements
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Real-time research agents that debate internally before providing answers.
- **Truth & Evaluation Layer**: Confidence scoring and automated source agreement checks for all AI answers.
- **Personal Knowledge Graph (Dynamic)**: Transform the current static mockup into a dynamic, interactive D3.js or Force-Directed graph that visualizes real memories and their connections.

## 2. Advanced Automation (Workflows)
- **Natural Language Automations**: "When I favorite a YouTube video, summarize it and send it to my 'Learning' Slack channel."
- **Trigger-Based Workflows**: Automatic ingestion based on email attachments or GitHub commits.
- **Cross-App Sync**: Deep two-way integration with Notion, Obsidian, and Slack.

## 3. Specialized AI Modules (Functional Backend)
- **Voice Cloning (Active)**: Implement the actual cloning logic using the audio-out pipeline.
- **UI-to-Code**: Moving beyond mockups to actually generate and export functional React components from the 'Design' module.
- **Financial Forecasting**: AI-driven predictive modeling based on the expense data logged in the 'Finance' module.

## 4. Personal OS Features
- **Daily Intelligence Brief**: A personalized morning summary of new knowledge, upcoming tasks, and health insights.
- **Learning Decay Tracking**: AI that monitors how well you remember ingested content and schedules "spaced repetition" reviews.
- **Adaptive Tutoring**: A tutor that adjusts its teaching style (Beginner vs. Expert) based on your detected knowledge level.

## 5. Mobile & Ecosystem
- **Native Browser Extension**: A real Chrome/Edge extension to "Capture to OneAI" with one click.
- **Mobile Companion App**: Quick voice-entry and scan-to-ingest capabilities for physical documents.
- **Desktop "Intelligence Overlay"**: A global shortcut (Cmd+K) to query your OneAI memory from any application.

*Note: These features can be added incrementally to evolve the platform from an MVP into a full Personal Intelligence OS.*
